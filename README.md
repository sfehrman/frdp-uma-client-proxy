ForgeRock Demonstration Platform : **UMA Client Proxy** : A gateway and "REST proxy" for [User-Managed Access (UMA) 2.0](https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/uma/Home) Requesting Party Clients.  The UMA Client Proxy provides a simplified interface to the [UMA 2.0 Grant for OAuth 2.0 Authorization](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2.0.html) flow.

A typical UMA client flow has the following steps: 

1. The **Requesting Party** (using the Client Application) makes a request to obtain the "resource", from the **Resource Server**. The **Resource Server** returns a `Permission Ticket` because of either a missing or invalid `Requesting Party Token (RPT)`.
1. The **Requesting Party** needs to authenticate with the **Authorization Server** and obtain an OAuth `authorization code`.
1. The `authorization code` and the Client OAuth credentials are used to obtain a `Claim Token` from the **Authorization Server**.
1. Using the `Permission Ticket` and the `Claim Token` ... the `Requesting Party Token (RPT)` is obtained from the **Authorization Server**.
1. With a valid `Requesting Party Token (RPT)` ... the request for the "resource" is re-submitted to the **Resource Server**.  The "resource" is returned.

Each UMA **Requesting Party** Client Application will need to implement all of these steps to support the UMA flow.  The **UMA Client Proxy** simplifies Client Application development.  A single REST call is made. The **UMA Client Proxy** can cache `Requesting Party Tokens (RPT)` for improved performance.

# Overview

This repository supports multiple sub-projects:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `gateway` | The core logic for processing the UMA Client flow and supports caching.  The output is a JAR file which provides Java classes that can be used by a stand-alone REST service or embedded into an existing service. |
| `proxy` | The REST web service that provides the simplified interface for the **UMA Client Application**.  This project leverages the `gateway` project. |

# Requirements

The following items must be installed:

1. [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) *(tested with 3.5.x, 3.6.x)*
1. [Java Development Kit 11](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/)
1. [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/index.html) *(tested with Tomcat 9.0.x)*
1. [ForgeRock Access Manager](https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management) *(tested with 7.0)*
1. [UMA Resource Server](https://github.com/ForgeRock/frdp-uma-resource-server)

# Build

## Prerequisite:

The following items must be completed, in the following order:

1. [frdp-framework](https://github.com/ForgeRock/frdp-framework) ... clone / download then install using *Maven* (`mvn`)

## Gateway:

Run *Maven* (`mvn`) processes to clean, compile and install the jar file:

```bash
cd gateway
mvn clean compile install
```
Packages are added to the user's home folder:

```bash
find ~/.m2/repository/com/forgerock/frdp/uma/client-gateway
/home/forgerock/.m2/repository/com/forgerock/frdp/uma/client-gateway
/home/forgerock/.m2/repository/com/forgerock/frdp/uma/client-gateway/maven-metadata-local.xml
/home/forgerock/.m2/repository/com/forgerock/frdp/uma/client-gateway/1.2.0
/home/forgerock/.m2/repository/com/forgerock/frdp/uma/client-gateway/1.2.0/client-gateway-1.2.0.jar
/home/forgerock/.m2/repository/com/forgerock/frdp/uma/client-gateway/1.2.0/client-gateway-1.2.0.pom
/home/forgerock/.m2/repository/com/forgerock/frdp/uma/client-gateway/1.2.0/_remote.repositories
```

### Testing:

Use the `TestGateway.java` program to confirm the gateway is configured and operational.  There **must** be a properly configured **Authorization Server** and **Resource Server**.  Edit the `target/classes/gateway.properties` file to match the deployed servers.  You will need to set the following properties:

#### Resource Server connection 

- `rs.connect.protocol http`
- `rs.connect.host rs.example.com`
- `rs.connect.port 8090`

#### Authorization Server connection

- `as.connect.protocol http`
- `as.connect.host as.example.com`
- `as.connect.port 8080`

#### Authorization Server OAuth Client 

- `as.oauth2.client.id UMA-RqP`
- `as.oauth2.client.secret password`
- `as.oauth2.client.redirect http://rqp.example.com/requesting-party`

Run the `test.sh` script which sets the Java classpath and runs the `TestGateway` program:

```bash
./test.sh 
Feb 26, 2021 11:02:24 AM com.forgerock.frdp.uma.client.CachingGateway$CacheCleaner <init>
INFO: com.forgerock.frdp.uma.client.CachingGateway$CacheCleaner created
...
```

## Proxy:

### Installation:

#### Compile and Package:

Run *Maven* (`mvn`) processes to clean, compile and package the war file:

```bash
cd proxy
mvn clean compile package
```

The *package* process creates a deployable war file, in the current directory: ./target:

```bash
ls -la ./target
total 21040
drwxr-xr-x   6 scott.fehrman  staff       192 Feb 25 21:05 .
drwxr-xr-x  10 scott.fehrman  staff       320 Feb 25 21:05 ..
drwxr-xr-x   3 scott.fehrman  staff        96 Feb 25 21:05 classes
drwxr-xr-x   3 scott.fehrman  staff        96 Feb 25 21:05 maven-archiver
drwxr-xr-x   5 scott.fehrman  staff       160 Feb 25 21:05 uma-proxy
-rw-r--r--   1 scott.fehrman  staff  10772167 Feb 25 21:05 uma-proxy.war
```

#### Deploy war file:

Copy the `uma-proxy.war` file to the `webapps` folder in the Tomcat server installation.  The running Tomcat server will automatically unpack the war file.

```bash
cp ./target/uma-proxy.war TOMCAT_INSTALLATION/webapps
```

The deployed proxy service needs to be configured for the **Authorization Server** and **Resource Server**. Edit the `proxy.properties` file:

```bash
cd TOMCAT_INSTALLATION/webapps/uma-proxy/WEB-INF/config
vi proxy.properties
```

You will need to verify / update these properties:

- `rs.connect.protocol http`
- `rs.connect.host rs.example.com`
- `rs.connect.port 8090`
- `as.connect.protocol http`
- `as.connect.host as.example.com`
- `as.connect.port 8080`
- `as.oauth2.client.id UMA-RqP`
- `as.oauth2.client.secret password`
- `as.oauth2.client.redirect http://rqp.example.com/requesting-party`

Restart the Tomcat server

### Test

The deployed `uma-proxy` service has a home page `http://FQDN/uma-proxy` with curl examples.  The examples cover the following UMA Proxy end-points:

| Name | Method | URL |
| ---- | ------ | --- |
| Shared with me | GET | `https://FQDN/uma-proxy/rest/share/withme` |
| Discoverable | GET | `https://FQDN/uma-proxy/rest/share/owners/__OWNER__/discover` |
| Get Resource | GET | `https://FQDN/uma-proxy/rest/share/resources/__RESOURCEID__/?scopes=content` |
| Revoke my access | DELETE | `https://FQDN/uma-proxy/rest/share/resources/__RESOURCEID__/policy` |
